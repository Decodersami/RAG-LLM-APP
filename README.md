# Retrieval Augmented Generation App Using LlamaIndex and OpenAI-Indexing

This project is aimed at developing a retrieval augmented generation application that leverages LlamaIndex and OpenAI-Indexing to efficiently search, retrieve, and generate content from multiple PDF documents.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, the volume of information stored in PDF documents is enormous, ranging from research papers to technical manuals. However, accessing and utilizing this information effectively can be challenging due to the sheer volume of data and the limitations of traditional search methods. This project addresses these challenges by combining the power of LlamaIndex and OpenAI-Indexing to create an application that enables efficient retrieval and generation of content from PDF documents.

## Features

- **Efficient Search**: The application utilizes LlamaIndex and OpenAI-Indexing to perform fast and accurate searches across multiple PDF documents.
- **Content Retrieval**: Users can retrieve relevant content from PDF documents based on their search queries.
- **Content Generation**: Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI-Indexing, the application can generate coherent and contextually relevant content based on the retrieved information.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction, making it easy for users to search, retrieve, and generate content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the retrieval augmented generation app:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up the required API keys for LlamaIndex and OpenAI-Indexing.
4. Run the application using `npm start`.
5. Access the application through the provided interface and start searching, retrieving, and generating content from PDF documents.

   
## Create Virtual Environment Steps:

1. conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
2.  or y
3. conda activate venv/
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
5. pip install ipykernel

## Dependencies
